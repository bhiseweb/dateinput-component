It is an date input field application. It is built using dart2.1 and angular5. I used angular_components material ui to implement date input.

On main page you can find multiple examples with respect to different date input properties.

### Here are steps to setup and run application :

* Clone application `git clone https://github.com/bhiseweb/dateinput-component.git`

* Access directory `cd dateinput-component`

* Install dependencies `pub get`

* Run server `webdev serve`

Note: Dart must be installed to run application.
